	<h1><strong> What is Matrix?</strong></h1>
	<p>“The Matrix has you,” Neo’s computer tells him. What is the Matrix exactly? In the movie, it’s a virtual reality (VR) world into which people are plugged while their bodies are used for energy by a race of artificially intelligent beings.</p>
	<p>The word matrix originated in the 15th century, according to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), and referred to the womb (echoing the womb-like pods Neo and the others are kept in). The science fiction meaning, basically the equivalent of cyberspace, might have been coined in a 1976 episode of Doctor Who, “Deadly Assassin”: “How can you intercept thought patterns within the matrix itself?” </p> <p>The matrix as a VR-world might have first appeared in the 1984 novel by William Gibson, The Neuromancer: "He'd operated on an almost permanent adrenaline high ... jacked into a custom cyberspace deck that projected his disembodied consciousness into the consensual hallucination that was the matrix."</p> <br>

	<h2> <strong>What happened? </strong></h2>
	<p>In the near future, Computer hacker Neo is contacted by underground freedom fighters who explain that reality as he understands it is actually a complex computer simulation called the Matrix. Created by a malevolent Artificial Intelligence, the Matrix hides the truth from humanity, allowing them to live a convincing, simulated life in 1999 while machines grow and harvest people to use as an ongoing energy source.</p> <p>The leader of the freedom fighters, Morpheus, believes Neo is "The One" who will lead humanity to freedom and overthrow the machines. Together with Trinity, Neo and Morpheus fight against the machine's enslavement of humanity as Neo begins to believe and accept his role as "The One".</p> <br>

	<h3><strong> Who is the main character?</strong> </h3>
	<p>Neo has a couple of meanings. It's an anagram for "one," as in the One who will save humanity, and also means “new” as in the new, freshly-born person now aware of the Matrix. </p> <p>The name Thomas Anderson also has significance. Thomas comes from an Aramaic word that means “twin.” Agent Smith tells Neo, “It seems that you have been living two lives,” one as program writer Thomas Anderson and the other as hacker Neo. Thomas might also refer to doubting Thomas, the apostle who refused to believe in Jesus’s resurrection until he fingered the wounds himself. As for Anderson, it means “son of man,” perhaps to emphasize Neo's humanity.</p> <br>

	<h5> <strong> Symbolism of Names</strong> </h5>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Matrix</strong> in the dictionary refers to <em>"a situation or surrounding substance within which something else originates, develops, or is contained. The womb."</em> Additionally, the concept of the Matrix as an illusion or a <em>'construct'</em> that humans are unaware of resembles the idea of Samsara in Buddhism and Hinduism. Samsara teaches that the world we consider 'real' is actually a projection of our own desires. From Morpheus Neo learns that how he'd perceived himself in the Matrix was simply a <em>"the mental projection of your digital self."</em> The <em>"real" sensory world "is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain."</em></li>
	<br>
	<li><strong>Neo</strong> in latin means new. It's also an anagram of <em>"one"</em>. Thomas Anderson, Neo's given name relates to <em>'doubting Thomas'</em> in the bible when he doesn't believe he is the One. <em>Anderson</em> means <em>'son of man'</em> which is a messianic title.</li><br>
	<li><strong>The Oracle</strong> in greek history was an intermediary between god and man. People could ask an Oracle questions and get an answer, sometimes in a riddle format that often wouldn't make sense until later. In the Matrix she says, <em>"You know what that means? It's Latin. Means know thyself." "Know thyself"</em> is inscribed upon the Oracle of Apollo and attributed to the Delphic Oracle, Greece, 6th century B.C.</li><br>
	<li><strong>Trinity</strong> represents the number three which is a powerful number in many stories and traditions. In keeping with the Christian themes, the <em>'father'</em>, <em>'son'</em>, <em>'holy spirit'</em> seems to be related here. In The Matrix, Morpheus, Trinity, and Neo fight the machines.</li><br>
	<li><strong>Morpheus</strong> means <em>the fashioner</em> or <em>molder</em>, because of the shapes he calls up before the sleeper, in classical mythology. He is the god of dreams, which ties in with the sleep/dream theme that runs throughout the Matrix.</li><br>
	<li><strong>Cypher</strong> is the classic betrayer, the Judas Iscariot. The word refers to a mathematical symbol denoting an absence of quantity, a zero. Also, someone with no value, a nonentity. It's also potentially related to Satan (the name could be a shortened version of <em>'Lucifer'</em>). Cypher also has a goatee and wears red early in The Matrix which relate to popular images of Satan.</li><br>
